	<p>I feel like when I am designing a lot of these principles go hand in hand. For example, if your design is  innovative then it probably makes the product useful. As a Graphic Designer, I think the main principles I always try to incorporate in my designs are “long lasting” or as I would prefer to call it, timeless; as well as aesthetics. Who would want to design something ugly? Being thorough is what I struggle with most because well, school is very difficult for me. If I don’t have an interest in what I am designing, I’m not going to put  110% of my energy into making the project look as perfect as possible, because frankly I just don’t care (and that;s that on character flaws). As soon as I am designing something I am passionate about or maybe super excited about, I will make sure everything, down to the simplest detail, is designed well.
